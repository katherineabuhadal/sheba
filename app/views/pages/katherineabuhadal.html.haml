%h1 About

%p Greetings and thank you for visiting Sheba Yemeni Foods!
%p The goal of the website is to share recipes and also to be an inspirational site which depicts food in a beautiful way.
%p My name is Katherine Abu Hadal and I am the creator of the Sheba blog. No, I am not from Yemen, my interest in Yemeni and Arabic food comes from the time I spent there several years ago. I learned to cook a lot of things from my husband's family mostly just by watching. Since there are not a lot of written sources either online or published in books, I decided to make a recipe site dedicated to Yemeni food which preserves and shares the recipes with other people. Since I know how hard it is to get the idea of a new recipe just from reading about it, I also make videos and maintain a YouTube channel.
%p Also, I pretty much make the recipes up from scratch unless otherwise noted, and I realize that there are many ways of cooking one dish and also regional variations. But I surely don't mind if you have a helpful comment about how to improve a recipe. If you leave it in the comments below the recipe, other people can benefit too. I do go back and edit the recipes or add new info if I discover something new which others can benefit from. I like to think that I am creating an encyclopedia of recipes which is always getting better.
